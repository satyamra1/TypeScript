# 🌟 TypeScript: A Developer's Guide

TypeScript is a powerful **superset of JavaScript** that adds static typing and robust tooling to JavaScript. It helps developers write clean, reliable, and scalable code.

> **TS = JavaScript + Additional Features**

---
## 📌 What is TypeScript?

TypeScript builds on JavaScript by adding optional types, classes, and interfaces. It is designed for the development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript.

---

## 🤔 Why Use TypeScript?

TypeScript enhances developer experience by:

- Adding **type safety** to catch bugs early.
- Supporting **object-oriented programming** concepts like:
  - Type Aliases
  - Interfaces
  - Abstract Classes
  - Encapsulation
  - Inheritance
  - Function Overloading
- Making large codebases **easier to manage and scale**.

---

## 🌐 Frontend or Backend?

TypeScript is **neither exclusively frontend nor backend** — it’s a language extension.

- Commonly used in **frontend frameworks** like Angular, React, Vue.
- Works seamlessly with **backend technologies** like Node.js.

---

## ⚙️ TypeScript Setup Guide

Here’s how you can set up TypeScript in your project:

### 🔧 Step-by-Step Commands:

```bash
npm i -g typescript         # Install TypeScript globally
tsc -v                      # Verify the installation
npm init -y                 # Initialize a Node project
npx tsc --init              # Generate tsconfig.json
````

### 📁 Project Structure:

Create the following folder structure:

```
/src    → Place your TypeScript source files here
/dist   → Compiled JavaScript output will go here
```

### 🛠️ Update `tsconfig.json`:

Make sure to configure input/output directories:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "outDir": "./dist"
  }
}
```

---

## 📂 Why a `dist` Folder?

The `dist` folder is the output directory for compiled JavaScript files. When you build your TypeScript code, it transpiles into vanilla JS and is stored in this folder.

---

## 🧠 What is Type Inference?

TypeScript can **automatically detect** variable types even if you don't explicitly specify them.

### Example:

```ts
let username = "Satyam"; // Inferred as string
```

---

## ✅ Advantages of Using TypeScript

1. Shows **errors at compile time**, not just runtime.
2. Implements **type inference** for smarter development.
3. Encourages **strict typing** for clean and safe code.
4. Great tooling support with **intellisense** and **autocompletion**.

---

## 💡 How to Use TypeScript

Assign explicit types to your variables to prevent unexpected behavior.

### Example:

```ts
let abc: string = "Satyam";
```

---

## 📘 Conclusion

TypeScript empowers JavaScript developers with modern features, error checking, and scalability. Whether you're building frontend UIs or backend APIs, TypeScript improves productivity and code quality.

 ## Interface 
 It acts as a blueprint, specifying the properties and methods that an entity should have, along with their respective types, without providing any implementation details.

It comes in **2** senerio :-
- Classes
- Object

```

```
**Optional Chaining**:-

Optional chaining in TypeScript, using the ?. operator, provides a safe and concise way to access properties or call methods within deeply nested objects or arrays, even when intermediate properties in the chain might be null or undefined.
---
 ## How it works:
- When the ?. operator is used, if any part of the chain evaluates to null or undefined, the entire expression short-circuits and returns undefined instead of throwing a runtime error (like "Cannot read property 'x' of undefined").
- This eliminates the need for verbose and repetitive if or && checks to ensure the existence of each level in a nested structure before attempting to access a property. 
For example:-
---  
interface User{
    name:String,
    age:number,
    isMale?:boolean,  //optional chaining
    email?:String,   // optional chaining
    password:number
}

```

```

**How to create Class in TS**
interface Person{
    name:string,
    age:number,
    greet(phrase:string):void
}
class Student implements Person{
    // this is for key
    name : string;
    age : number;
    constructor(name:string,age:number){
        this.name = name;
        this.age =age;

    }
    greet(phrase:string){
        console.log(`${phrase} ${this.name}`);
    }
}
let s1 =new Student("Satyam",21)
s1.greet("hello from")

```

```
## Type in TS
- Type aliases are more versatile than interfaces. They can define custom names for any type, including:
  - Primitive types (e.g., string, number, boolean)
  - Union types (e.g., string | number)
  - Intersection types (e.g., TypeA & TypeB)
  - Tuple types (e.g., [string, number]) 

Example:-

**type** Sat = number | string

function sat(abc:Sat){
    
}
- **Edge Case in type** :-
 We can not use or ("|") in class if we have created 2 types and implemented it with eachother. It gives error.
```
```
 ## Array in TS and Array of Objects in TS
